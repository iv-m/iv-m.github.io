          <div class="intro"><p><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> is open-source optimizing compiler for Python. It seems work like magic: just add a simple decorator to your pure-python function, and it immediately becomes 200 times faster – at least, so clames the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Numba&amp;oldid=831668946">Wikipedia article about Numba</a>. Even this is hard to believe, but Wikipedia goes further and claims that a vary naive implementation of a sum of a numpy array is 30% faster then <code>numpy.sum</code>. Somehow, I would expect that <code>numpy.sum</code> is as optimized as it can be, so this clame sounds even more ambitious. Let’s check this with some<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>benchmarks!</p>

Python look like craziness. But with the years are passing,

magic, like metaclasses and descriptors. But what if a simple language
construct, in a simple code, just makes you stop and say <em>“<span class="caps">WAT</span>?”</em>.
That’s exactly what happened to me when I saw this: <code>x = x[::-1]</code>.
What does <em>that</em> mean? Let’s take a quick<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>look.</p>
