## Learning Machine Learning

### ML courses from Yandex: Машинное обучение и анализ данных

* https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis

A set of good introductory courses for diving into the topic. In Russian.

Note that, as with most of Coursera courses, you can audit all the courses
from this specialization. You won't get the certificate and won't be able
to submit the practical assignments, but you'll all the videos and materials
-- for free.


## Learning Deep Learning

### Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

* http://cs231n.stanford.edu
* Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC

Good deep learning course from Stanford University. Really nice practical
tasks. The best back propogation explanation ever.

The YouTube link above is not the latest one, it's from 2016 where
it was mostly read by [Andrej Karpathy], who is *very cool*.  You
can find 2017 videos on the net, but the updates are not very significant.

### Standford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

* http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/
* Videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6

The title says it all. Not bad.


### Deep Learning specialization from deeplearning.ai

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

I did not look at it, but it *must* be good: the primary author is *Andrew Ng*.


### Advanced Machine Learning, from Yandex and HSE

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml

Pretty ok set of courses. Videos are, in my opinion, too terse, but practical
tasks are nice. Includes the famous course ["How to Win a Data Science Competition:
Learn from Top Kagglers"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science).
