  h1 Pale of notes
  p I'm often making notes while learning stuff. Most of the notes are
    so small so they won't worth a separate article; some notes might
    grow into an article one day.
  p.warn Most of the notes are permanent work-in-progress. I mean, expect
    seeing quite a mess here.
  h2 Notes, in order of appearance
  ul
    each note in env.helpers.getPagesSortedBy(contents, 'notes', lut)
      li
        a(href=note.url)= note.title
        small &nbsp;(updated on #{ env.helpers.getLastUpdateTime(note.filepath.relative) })
